      <h2>Data overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, this project compares real-time data (data that indicates which bus trips 
        actually happened) with schedule data (the trips that the CTA said in advance would happen). 
        Currently, the information shown on the website reflects data collected from May 20 to November 5, 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        The real-time data is scraped from the CTA bus tracker API

        Schedule data is collected from the CTA General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed data.

        5 November 2022 is compiled from{" "}

        Days that a new schedule feed was published by CTA are excluded from analysis. At the time of writing,

      <h2>Data notes and limitations</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to acknowledge that real-time data is not perfect. GPS devices can fail or break, 
        for example, and so it’s possible that there are bus trips that did happen but are not captured in 
        the real-time data. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, the data we are scraping represents the data that the CTA is making available to 3rd party
        bus-tracking apps and to riders. Riders make decisions based on the data that is available at the time 
        they travel. This means that inaccurate or missing real-time data can affect riders’ ability to plan 
        their journeys, even if there are more trips actually occurring than are counted in the real-time data. 
        Real-time data captures the trips that a rider could have known about if they were checking 
        a tracking app or service, even if it does not completely capture all trips that occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an all-volunteer project, and for our current launch we have not done granular row-level 
        data cleaning. We observed, for example, that for a small number of trips on the 66 Chicago bus, 
        the trip ID was missing in the source data from the API and was only listed as a series of asterisks (like ********). We have not 
        added any special handling or cleaning for that, so we may be slightly undercounting the number of 
        actual trips that occurred on that route. We saw the same issue on the #74 Fullerton bus and assumed
        it was not widespread; however, after the data had been displayed on the site for several months
        we investigated further and realized that the data issue is common enough for the #74 that it made
        our display inaccurate. We have removed the #74 bus for the time being; we are not sure whether we 
        will find a valid method to overcome the issue to reinstate the #74 bus on our map. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to help us improve our data cleaning, we would love to have you!

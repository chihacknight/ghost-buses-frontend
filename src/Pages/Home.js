        You’re waiting to catch your bus. The schedule app says it’ll be there
        in two minutes. You wait, and no bus comes. Now you’re stranded. Should
        you spring for an expensive rideshare? Should you start walking?

        If you’re a regular rider of the CTA, odds are you’ve been “ghosted” by
        your bus. While the pandemic put an understandable strain on transit
        systems, these days Chicago residents have commitments that require
        travel, and the CTA is struggling to keep up. Most importantly, the
        CTA's official schedules do not represent this change in service,
        leading to confusion, delays, and a general sense of distrust in our
        city’s public transit.

        Ghost Bus is a Chi Hack Night project conducted by volunteer data
        scientists, engineers, and researchers. Our project compares open source
        real-time bus tracking data to the CTA’s official schedules to identify
        gaps in service across Chicago’s bus lines.
